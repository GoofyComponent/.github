### What is GoofySera ?

SeRA for Saline _**Experience**_ Royal academy, is a DAM (Digital Asset Management).
This web application is designed to improve the production methods of the Saline Royale's online courses.
Realized for our final project of our diploma at Hetic.
This project brings together all the skills learned during our work-study placements and our last 3 years.
Powered by React and Laravel under our own network architecture.
We had to imagine this app from A to Z, designing our own CIs, our own codebase, etc...
